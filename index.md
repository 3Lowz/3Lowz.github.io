# Hi There, Welcome!

Loving my ordinary to make extraordinary things

## Who am I

I am passionate and curious software developer who has always pushed himself forward out of the comfort zone. I like to describe myself as a software engineer due to my tendency to look at all the aspect of the software development, lately on the security risks. I've started from the tasks organization and planning with time estimations, to the CD/CI pipelines and also with the applications refactors applying proper patterns and optimization. It allowed me to build a strong sight on possible bottlenecks when designing software and enhanced my capacity to help my team to solve problems.
